      <P>MRI scans from multiple individuals will vary greatly due to 
      differences in slice orientation and brain features (i.e. brain size and 
      shape varies across individuals). Therefore, it is generally useful to '<A 
      href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/mritut.html#Li near">normalize</A>' 
      scans to a standard template. Normalization is the process of translating, 
      rotating, scaling, and maybe warping a brain to roughly match a standard 
      template image.</P>
      <P>After normalization, it may be informative to report locations using 
      stereotaxic ("Talairach") coordinates. This format uses three numbers 
      (X,Y,Z) to describe the distance from the <A 
      href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/antcomm.html">Anterior 
      Commissure</A> (the 'origin' of Talairach space). The X,Y,Z dimensions 
      refer to left-right, posterior-anterior, and ventral-dorsal respectively. 
      So 38x-64x58mm refers to a point in right posterior dorsal region of the 
      brain. If you have normalized your brain to one matching the brain in the 
      Talairach atlas, then you can examine the Talairach atlas to get a general 
      idea of the region you are describing. Because most neuroimagers 
      coregister their images with a template from the Montreal Neurological 
      Institute, readers can also examine an MNI template (as there are some <A 
      href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/mnispace.html">differences 
      between the MNI brain and the Talairach brain</A>). The next section will 
      describe some limitations in making comparisons between brains.</P></TD>

    <TD><STRONG>Limitations of Comparisons</STRONG>
      <P>Like fingerprints, each brain has a unique configuration of gyri and 
      sulci. In fact, secondary and tertiary sulci are not found in all 
      individuals [Ono et al. 1990, Atlas of Cerebral Sulci]. This makes it 
      difficult and probably undesirable for software to precisely match sulci 
      between different individuals. In addition, because the sulci can have 
      very different configurations, software which attempted to match sulci 
      would create severe local distortions. Therefore, most normalization 
      software smooths brain images before attempting normalization. The detail 
      of sulcal information is greatly reduced by this smoothing process (Figure 
      2 shows a sample image, and the same image after smoothing).</P>
      <P>Therefore, the normalized images for any two individuals will not have 
      the sulci and gyri in the same locations. As a consequence, stereotaxic 
      coordinates do not necessarily refer to a specific sulcal location. In 
      this way, stereotaxic coordinates are 'probabilistic' [Mazziotta et al 
      1995, Neuroimage, 2: 89-101]. Figure 3 shows the variability of sulcal 
      location after normalization in 15 healthy individuals, after a 
      normalization based on matching the location of the major sulci (courtesy 
      of Paul Thompson's lab).</P>
      <P>Also, note that brain function may not be specifically located to 
      specific sulci. So sulcal location and stereotaxic space may both be 
      probabilistic in terms of functional location. In a study of cortical 
      cytoarchitecture, Zilles et al. (1997, Human Brain Mapping 5: 228-221) 
      noted that "sulci are not generally valid landmarks of the microstructural 
      organization of the cortex". </P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the cytoarchitecture can not be directly examined in 
      living humans. Therefore stereotaxic coordinates and sulcal landmarks are 
      the best we can do.</P></TD>

    <TD><STRONG>Identifying Brodmann's Areas</STRONG>
      <P>Brodmann (1909) classified brain regions based on their 
      cytoarchitecture (basically, the appearance of the cortex under the light 
      microscope). In some instances there is a clear link between the 
      microscopic appearance of a region and its function. For example, the 
      'stripe' of the striate cortex delineates the first main cortical area of 
      the visual system (today this area is usually referred to as V1, Brodmann 
      called it area 17). However, it is important to remember that Brodmann's 
      Areas (BAs) were identified purely based on visual appearance, which is 
      not necessarily related to function.</P>
      <P>Attempting to convert stereotaxic coordinates based on MRI scans to 
      Brodmann areas based on cytoarchitecture faces several problems. First, as 
      noted earlier, Zilles et al. have found that there can be only approximate 
      correspondence between sulcal landmarks or stereotaxic space and 
      cytoarchitecture. Second, while many atlases define BAs (somewhat 
      arbitrarily) as being segmented at sulcal fundus, sulcal location varies 
      tremendously between individuals (see the previous section). </P>
      <P>Atlases such as the online <A 
      href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/talairachdaemon.html">Talairach 
      Daemon</A> and <A href="http://stp.wustl.edu/">Van Essen and Drury's 
      Caret</A> software can approximate between stereotaxic location and BAs, 
      although the derivation of the BAs can be obscure, and in neither case is 
      based on cytoarchitectonic data from the individual brains. These tools 
      should be used with extreme caution, because of the inherent uncertainty 
      of the information they contain. Given the problems with these BA 
      estimates, it is attractive to take a more conservative approach, and 
      define locations based on stereotaxic coordinates or (where activity 
      across individuals appears to be correlated more strongly with sulcal 
      landmarks than Talairach space) to sulcal locations. The main reason for 
      converting between stereotaxic space and BAs is when comparing human work 
      to animal research (where direct stereotaxic comparisons are 
      impossible).</P></TD>

    <TD><STRONG>Locating Sulci and Gyri</STRONG>
      <P>It is important to remember that neither stereotaxic coordinates nor 
      cytoarchitecture perfectly correspond with gyri and sulci. For reporting 
      data from stereotaxically aligned images, it is generally a good idea to 
      present both stereotaxic coordinates and an image, so that readers can 
      identify relevant landmarks. Once MRI scans have been normalized, they may 
      roughly match the Talairach atlas or the online <A 
      href="http://ric.uthscsa.edu/projects/talairachdaemon.html">Talairach 
      Daemon</A>, and you can refer to these sources to locate the relevant 
      sulci, gyri, and (with a lower degree of accuracy) the Brodmann Area. As 
      noted earlier, some brains do not show all of the sulci, and there are 
      different sulcal configurations. Therefore, care should be taken when 
      identifying a sulcus.</P></TD>
