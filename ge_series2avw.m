function [ avw ] = ge_series2avw(examPath,seriesPath)

% ge_series2avw - converts a GE series to Analyze
% 
% avw = ge_series2avw(examPath,seriesPath)
% 
% Converts a series of GE slices into an Analyze 
% avw struct (see avw_read), which can be output
% as an Analyze .hdr/.img pair using avw_write.
% 
% examPath   - string path to an exam directory, 
%              which contains series directories 
%              below it
% seriesPath - the series to convert
%              (integer or string argument)
% 
% examPath is the name of the directory containing 
% the series subdirectories (e.g., series 1), which 
% contain the series image files (*.MR or I.*).  
% This function calls ge_series_read.
% 
% The function will attempt to reorient the GE 
% 3D volume into radiological orientation 
% (axial LAS, which is the default Analyze 
% orientation).  The resulting data should
% be SPM compatible when output with avw_write.
% 
% This function is in alpha development (as of 03/2003) 
% although a prior version has been tested with 
% Ax,Sag,Cor slices (with slice direction going both 
% ways). It was also tested for oblique axial, but 
% not on double obliques or anything more complicated.  
% The function does not provide information for an 
% SPM compatible .mat file.
% 
% see also ge_series_read, 
%          avw_view, avw_read, avw_write
