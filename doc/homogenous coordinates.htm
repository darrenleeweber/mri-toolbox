<P>Homogenous coordinates utilize a mathematical trick to embed 
three-dimensional coordinates and transformations into a four-dimensional matrix 
format. As a result, inversions or combinations of linear transformations are 
simplified to inversion or multiplication of the corresponding matrices. 
Homogenous coordinates also make it possible to define perspective 
transformations.<BR></P>

<H4><A name=matrices></A>4x4 Homogenous Coordinate Transformation Matrices</H4>
<P>Homogenous coordinate transformation matrices operate on four-dimensional <A 
href="http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR5/homogenous.html#vectors">homogenous 
coordinate vector</A> representations of traditional three-dimensional 
coordinate locations. Any three-dimensional linear transformation (rotation, 
translation, skew, perspective distortion) can be represented by a 4x4 
homogenous coordinate transformation matrix. In fact, because of the redundant 
representation of three space in a homogenous coordinate system, an infinite 
number of different 4x4 homogenous coordinate transformation matrices are 
available to perform any given linear transformation. This redundancy can be 
eliminated to provide a unique representation by dividing all elements of a 4x4 
homogenous transformation matrix by the last element (which will become equal to 
one). This means that a 4x4 homogenous transformation matrix can incorporate as 
many as 15 independent parameters. The generic format representation of a 
homogenous transformation equation for mapping the three dimensional coordinate 
(x,y,z) to the three-dimensional coordinate (x',y',z') is:<BR><IMG height=61 
alt="" src="homogenous coordinates_files/homogenous.gif" width=260 
align=top><BR></P>
<P>If any two matrices or vectors of this equation are known, the third matrix 
(or vector) can be computed and then the redundant T element in the solution can 
be eliminated by dividing all elements of the matrix by the last element.</P>
<P>Various <A 
href="http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR5/models.html">transformation models</A> 
can be used to constrain the form of the matrix to tranformations with fewer 
degrees of freedom.</P>
<P>In many textbooks, you will find homogenous tranformation matrices defined 
such that 1x4 homogenous coordinate vectors are placed to the left of the 4x4 
homogenous coordinate transformation matrix and multiplied. This format is not 
supported in the AIR package and the difference accounts for the fact that 
translations are represented in the fourth column and perspective distortions in 
the fourth row of AIR homologous transformation matrices rather than vice 
versa.</P>
