<H1>The Analyze data format</H1></CENTER>
<P>This page gives some information and links about the the Analyze image data 
format. Analyze images are the primary image format used in SPM. SPM also uses 
some extensions to the basic format, which are described below. 
<P>
<H2>What is Analyze?</H2><A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/analyze.html" 
target=display_area>Analyze</A> is an image processing program, written by The 
Biomedical Imaging Resource at the Mayo Foundation. The Analyze data format is 
used by the Analyze program, and now by a wide variety of other software, 
including SPM. 
<P>
<H2>The basic Analyze (7.5) format</H2>There are two Analyze formats. One, by 
much the more common, is Analyze 7.5. This is the format used by SPM, and 
discussed on this page. The other is <A 
href="http://www.mayo.edu/bir/Software/Analyze/Analyze1.html">Analyze AVW</A>, 
the format used in the latest version of the Analyze program. We won't discuss 
AVW format any further, as it not yet used by many programs other than Analyze 
AVW itself. 
<P>An Analyze (7.5) format image consists of two files, and image and a header 
file. If the image is for example named "brain", then the files for that image 
will be called "brain.img" and "brain.hdr". The .img file contains the numbers 
that make up the information in the image. The .hdr file contains information 
about the img file, such as the volume represented by each number in the image 
(voxel size) and the number of pixels in the X, Y and Z directions. This header 
contains fields of text, floating point, integer and other information. 
<P>The SPM99 help system describes the SPM / Analyze image format - see <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/spm_format.html" 
target=display_area>an html version of the SPM99 help on image format</A>. 
<P>These links also describe the Analyze format in more detail:

  description of file format</A>. 
  <LI><A href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/distrib.html#AzeFmt">SPM/FIL 
  description of format</A> (this is a less detailed description that the SPM99 
  help system provides - see above). 
  <P>However, note that the SPM version of the Analyze format uses a couple of 
  the header fields in an unconventional way (see below) </P></LI></UL>

<H2>SPM modifications of the basic analyze format</H2>SPM uses the basic Analyze 
7.5 format, but with three modifications / extensions. These are:

  <H3>The scalefactor</H3>SPM extends the Analyze format by using a scaling 
  factor for the image from the header.<BR>The purpose of the scale factor is to 
  allow values in images that cannot be stored using the data type of the .img 
  file. For example, with an 8 bit image (.img file), all the values in the file 
  have to be between 0 and 255. SPM extends this, by using the scale factor to 
  'scale' the values in the img file. Thus, to get actual voxel values for the 
  image, you read in the numbers from the .img file (0-255 in an 8 bit image), 
  then multiply these values by the value from the scale factor, from the 
  header.<BR>The field in the header that SPM uses for the scale factor is 
  image_dimension.funused1 (see the header field definitions at the <A 
  href="http://www.mayo.edu/bir/PDF/ANALYZE75.pdf">Mayo/Analyze 
  site</A>).<BR>The scale factor is useful if the voxel values in the individual 
  images have meaning either relative to other images, or in some physiological 
  sense. For example, water activation PET images may have voxel values in 
  counts per voxel per second, and binding maps calculated for ligands may be 
  physiological values. These numbers are unlikely to range from 0-255 (which is 
  the range of an image with values stored in 8 bit), but can be rescaled to 
  this range by using the scale factor. An alternative would be floating point 
  images, but these are a) larger and b) not displayable in the earlier (pre 
  AVW) versions of Analyze. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>
  <H3>The image origin</H3>SPM uses one of the Analyze header fields in an 
  unorthodox way. This is the Originator field (data_history.originator - see <A 
  href="http://www.mayo.edu/bir/PDF/ANALYZE75.pdf">Mayo/Analyze site</A>). In 
  the basic format, this is meant to be 10 bytes of text. In SPM, this space is 
  used to contain three short (two byte) integers. These numbers describe the 
  current centre or 'Origin' of the image. Specifically, they give the 
  coordinate of the central voxel, in voxels, in X, then Y then Z. For example, 
  for images that are aligned to the templates, this Origin field would contain 
  the coordinates of the voxel nearest to the midline of the Anterior Commisure. 
  Note that if the Origin is set to 0 0 0, then SPM routines will assume that 
  the origin is in fact the central voxel of the image. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>
  <H3>The .mat file</H3>This is an addition to the Analyze format. It is another 
  file to add to the imagename.hdr / imagename.img pair - a imagename.mat file. 
  The file is in matlab .mat file format, and contains information on the 
  orientation of the image, generated by realignments, coregistration etc. See 
  the <A href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/spm_format.html">SPM99 help 
  on file format</A>, or in rather less detail, see the <A 
  href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/distrib.html#AzeFmt">SPM/FIL Analyze 
  format description</A>, under the heading "The *.mat file". </LI></UL>
