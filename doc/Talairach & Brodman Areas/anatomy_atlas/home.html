<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>This neuroanatomy atlas shows regions on normalized MRI scans.
Normalization is the process of warping a brain to match a
standard size, orientation and shape of other brains. You can
normalize MRI scans using programs like <a
href="http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ICBM/ICBM_AIR.html">AIR</a>, <a
href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/flirt/">FLIRT</a> or <a
href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">SPM</a>. Once
normalized, the overall shape of your MRI scan will approximately
match those in this atlas. However, normalization preserves the
unique sulcal features of each brain, so there will be some
variation between your image and the images shown in this atlas.
There is a great deal of individual variability even after
normalization, so any atlas is only a rough guide to the shape
and location of structures in an individuals brain. As I have
noted <a
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/brodmann_areas.html">before</a>,
secondary and tertiary sulci are not found in all individuals
[Ono et al. 1990, Atlas of Cerebral Sulci]. Another benefit of
normalizing brains is it makes it easy to complete an accurate
'scalp stripping' with brain extracting software (my MRIcro
software implements Steve Smith's BET for this task). You can
then create a useful volume rendering of the cortical surface.
Typically, it is much easier to identify cortical sulci and gyri
by looking at a rendered image of the brain's surface. This atlas
shows you how to recognize these landmarks on a rendered MRI
scan.</p>

        <td>Left: This figure shows how raw (original) MRI scans
        can be processed to make recognizing neuroanatomical
        landmarks easier. First, the image can be normalized,
        realigning the image so the overall shape of the image
        matches common atlases. Images can also be
        scalp-stripped, allowing the cortical surface to be
        rendered (making it easy to recognize many features).</td>

<p>A great way to use this atlas is to download a free copy of my
MRIcro software. This will let you view your own MRI scans, and <a
href="http://www.mricro.com">MRIcro</a> comes with the
&quot;ch2&quot; image that is used throughout this atlas. The
&quot;ch2&quot; MRI (referred to as 'single_subj_T1&quot; by SPM
users) is based on 27 T1 scans of a single individual. It is
great for learning about brain anatomy, but it is probably of
much higher quality than any other scans you will work with.
Therefore, I also have illustrated the neuroanatomical regions on
a more typical MRI scan: a single ultra-T1-weighted image (1.5
Tesla, MPRAGE sequence) from a volunteer at the University of
Nottingham. This scan helps you identify brain regions by
examining a clinical quality scan. Comparing ch2 to the clinical
scan, you can also observe the variability in the location of
structural regions following normalization. Due to popularity,
anatomical definition, resolution and speed of acquisition, this
atlas focuses on T1-weighted MRI scans. However,
neuropsychologists plotting lesions should also examine the
patient's <a href="http://www.mricro.com/mritut.html#creatingROI">T2
and proton density scans</a> as well. </p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td>It is worthwhile to describe the coordinate system
        used to define neuroanatomical locations of normalized
        images. The 'Talairach' coordinate system specifies
        locations relative to their distance from the anterior
        commisure (AC). The AC is a small but easy to spot
        region, making it an ideal origin for the coordinate
        system. Each location is described by three numbers, each
        describing the distance in millimeters from the AC: X is
        the left/right dimension, Y is the posterior/anterior
        dimension, and Z is the ventral/dorsal dimension.
        Therefore, the position 0x0x0 is precisely at the AC,
        while -32x21x10 is left (32mm), anterior (21mm) and
        dorsal (10mm) from the AC. In this atlas you will notice
        that axial slices are referred to by their Z coordinate
        and coronal images are referred to by their Y coordinate.
        Again, it is important to stress that normalization
        strives to retain the unique features of each individual
        brain, and therefore Talairach cordinates are only
        approximate when comparing locations to other
        individuals. More details can be found at the <a
