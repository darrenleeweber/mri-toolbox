<h1>MRI Orientation Notes</h1>

<p>The mri_toolbox download at 
<a href="http://eeg.sf.net">http://eeg.sf.net</a>
contains matlab code that employs the orient header field to read and 
orthotransform ANALYZE volumes (see the avw* functions).  In this code 
(ie, avw_img_read.m) there is complete documentation of the XYZ directions 
for all 6 orthogonal orientations defined by ANALYZE in the avw.hdr.hist.orient 
field, namely:<br>

<ul>
<li>          0,  transverse unflipped (LAS*)</li> 
<li>          1,  coronal unflipped (LA*S)</li> 
<li>          2,  sagittal unflipped (L*AS)</li> 
<li>          3,  transverse flipped (LPS*)</li> 
<li>          4,  coronal flipped (LA*I)</li> 
<li>          5,  sagittal flipped (L*AI)</li>
</ul>
where * follows the slice dimension and letters indicate +XYZ
orientations (L left, R right, A anterior, P posterior,
I inferior, &amp; S superior). These values can be used in avw_img_read or
avw_img_write to read/write the corresponding orientation correctly.</p>

<p>The default ANALYZE orientation is LAS (radiological orientation):<br> 
<ul>
<li>+X is <u>L</u>eft</li> 
<li>+Y is <u>A</u>nterior</li> 
<li>+Z is <u>S</u>uperior</li>
</ul>
This corresponds to: avw.hdr.hist.orient = 0, transverse unflipped.</p>

<p>The neurological convention is RAS (only the direction of X is swapped):<br>
<ul>
<li>+X is <u>R</u>ight</li> 
<li>+Y is <u>A</u>nterior</li> 
<li>+Z is <u>S</u>uperior</li>
</ul>
This is also the 'Talairach' and MNI template coordinate system.

For more details on Talairach space and normalization with the MNI templates,
see the notes from Chris Rorden and Matthew Brett:<br>

         http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/mnispace.html</a>, where the latter
matlab functions are included in this toolbox.<br>
The standard analyze format does not support the neurological orientation in
either the hdr.hist.orient field or the .img file data order.  You can use 
avw_flip to obtain this, but it is a violation of the Analyze file
format.</p>

<p>This toolbox will try to load an Analyze volume (actually any .img file)
as an LAS volume, so long as the avw.hdr.hist.orient field is set correctly.  
Thus, the avw_view function should always present the volume in LAS (radiological) 
orientation (a GUI control allows easy L/R flipping for viewing purposes).  If 
you need to, you can use avw_flip to orthoflip any dimension, although this 
could easily invalidate the Analyze coordinate system (NOT recommended).</p>

<p>The avw.hdr.hist.orient field is "optional" and not all software will read
or write it correctly.  For example,
<a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">SPM</a> ignores it and 
<a href="http://www.sensor.com">MEDx</a> sets an unused header field.</p>

<p>The flipped orientations (orient values 3-5) are only defined in
Analyze to support a movie animation.  The flipping is not done in the slice
direction, but rather in the dimension that suits raster graphics.  The flipping
has NO relationship to the actual orientation of the volume, only to how the 
data is handled during graphics processes.  Thus, orient values 3-5 are NOT 
recommended. For example, for a transverse LAS volume, the orient=3 option 
flips to the anterior-posterior direction (LPS), which does not provide for 
saving RAS volumes.  Nevertheless, this toolbox will attempt to handle the 
flipped Analyze volumes correctly.</p>

<p>If your not sure what the orientation of a volume is, it is near impossible
to differentiate LAS from RAS without landmarks in the image.  A useful tool is
the flip L/R control in avw_view.  It will allow you to quickly flip left/right
to find visual cues that differentiate these two orientations.  Often the 
ventricles provide good asymmetry indicators.  Some high resolution T1 
anatomical data I have worked with was acquired with a small pinpoint 
artifact in the central voxel of the left most slice of the volume 
(what a great idea! except when it comes to intensity normalisation!).  It's
also possible to use radiological markers (a preferable method, perhaps, as it
should avoid the intensity artifact when normalising or correcting Bo field 
distortions).  If that information is not available to you, but you have 
the original scanner files, you can use your favourite software or some free
offerrings:
<a href="http://www.mricro.com/">http://www.mricro.com/</a> or 
<a href="http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net">http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net</a> 
to read the original scanner volume headers, which usually contain useful 
orientation information, if you can interpret it (maybe speak to your 
radiographer).  You might then use MRIcro or Xmedcon to convert
the original data to ANALYZE, in a specific orientation.  Keep careful track
of the orientation during this conversion, especially left/right.  Also 
consider acquisition of a small phantom volume, containing LAS orientation 
markers, in the sequence you use for your subject data.  You can then process 
that volume through all the stages of your analyses to confirm the final 
orientation.</p>

<p>When working with format conversions, consider these 
<a href="MJenkinson_coordtransforms.pdf">enlightening notes</a> from
Mark Jenkinson!</p>

<p>All the best getting it right.  MRI volume orientation has been a problem
for me, prompting development of the MRI_toolbox.  After better understanding 
how it works, the anxiety dissipates ;-) (although never really leaves you at 
peace). It's frustrating that our visuo-spatial intelligence for 3D object 
orientation virtually goes out the window when looking at ortho slices!  In 
reality, we know this is a simple problem, yet the ortho views are unyielding!</p>


<h3>Further comments on -X pixdim and neurological convention,
 with an illustration and some issues to clarify</h3>

<p>Just to get down to basics, imagine a 2D axial slice through the AC, 
viewed with the nose at the top.  Take a row of that image that passes from 
ear to ear.  This is the X dimension (Y is the posterior to anterior 
dimension). Simple enough.</p>

<p>The question is what is left or right?  Are we looking at this slice from
the feet up or from the top of the head down?  You can look for anatomical
asymetries and try to find "real-world" landmarks.  Alternatively, a
convention for the order of the data in the file should provide a reliable 
answer.</p>

<p>That is, if the "left side of the image" is pixel 1 (X=1) and the "right
side of the image" is pixel N (X=N), Analyze file format specifies that
pixel 1 is "patient right" and pixel N is "patient left", so the row pixel
numbers increase from right to left, ie +X is left (+Y is anterior and +Z is
superior, LAS).  So we are looking at this slice from the feet upwards.</p>

<p>A 2D image is stored in an .img file as a continuous data stream (say 8 bits
per pixel/voxel).  When reading this continuous data stream into a 2D matrix, 
it is divided up into M rows and N columns.  The header provides the information 
about how many rows (M) and how many columns (N), often they are the axial 
in-plane dimensions and equal, say 64x64, 128x128, or 256x256 (these values 
are in hdr.dime.dim).  For a 2D axial slice, the data stream can be read one 
row at a time and each row has N pixels.  For each row of the Analyze file, we have 
a column index 1:N, where index 1 is right and index N is left.</p>

<p>Thus, we can read an .img file without knowing anything about the size of the 
voxels.  We can completely ignore any hdr.dime.pixdim values when reading the 
.img file and we should have a data matrix where +X direction is left.</p>

<p>This is the radiological convention.  It is also the Analyze file convention.
To violate this convention is to risk confusion about left/right orientation, 
the most intractible orientation problem in tomography.</p>

<p>Any software working with .img files in the Analyze 7.5 format must be able to
rely on this convention to be able to display left/right properly.  There is
no way to determine left/right otherwise (although SPM has the .mat solution, 
which is itself a convention that *overrides* the Analyze file format).</p>

<p>So what happens when the pixdim is considered.  It provides information
about the real-world size of each pixel of each dimension.  We usually use 4
dimensions: X mm, Ymm, Zmm and Time in msec (although Analyze provides for
more dimensions).  OK, but what happens when we have a -ve pixdim value?</p>

<p>Analyze 7.5 format does not support the neurological convention (ie, +X right).
This causes a problem when using the Talairach atlas, which is given in 
neurological orientation.  The MNI has done some great work to provide templates 
for registration into Talairach space.  But how do you do this registration with 
Analyze files?</p>

<p>The MNI templates have a -X pixdim value.  Given that the Analyze format
specifies +X pixdim values and the radiological convention, this use of -X pixdim 
values indicates that the files are in neurological convention.  I have no idea 
whether the actual data order of the MNI template .img files is +X left or right.
It is possible that they could be either.  If +X is right, they are pseduo-Analyze
.img files.  If +X is left, the .img files can be read by any Analyze software 
that abides by the Analyze/radiological convention and the only question is what 
to do with the -ve pixdim value.</p>


<h4>Other software: FSL</h4>

<p>In essence, FSL does not determine left/right - only the number of rows,
columns, slices and timepoints and the absolute magnitude of voxels (mm) and
time (msec) is important, the rest is image intensity analysis. 
Normalisation/registration is mainly image intensity analysis, but also
involves <i>reslicing</i>.  One qestion is whether the MNI template 
.img files are +X right or +X left (regardless of their .hdr files) and 
whether this has any implications for the order of the data .img files after 
normalisation.  FSL relies on the order of the pixels in the .img file.  
Whatever goes into registration to the templates could come out with the same 
.img order as the templates, but only if the data is <i>resliced</i> into the 
template space and I don't think FSL does that.  In FSL, the MNI templates are 
resliced into the "native experimental data" space during registration.  I think
most, if not all, of FSL processing is done in "native experimental data space",
with Talairach coordinates provided from the FSL .mat files.  That is, I think 
FSL registers/reslices the templates to experimental volumes and then calculates
the inverse registration to get the Talairach coordinates (FSL .mat file). This 
avoids interpolation of the experimental data during registration, effectively 
leaving it entirely untouched.  <i>In this sense, what goes into FSL is what 
comes out it.</i>  But note that it is the .img files that are important, not 
whether the hdr.dime.pixdim is +ve or -ve. Please search the 
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A0=FSL">
FSL email archives</a> for more discussion on this topic (search for
"Registering Talairach and MNI152 Spaces").</p>

<h4>Other software: SPM/MRIcro</h4>

<p>SPM2 provides two specific alternatives for data orientation, either 
radiological (LAS) or neurological (RAS).  SPM uses a spatial transformation 
matrix to supplement the Analyze format, so you get *.hdr *.img and *.mat files,
where the .mat file holds all spatial transformations.  Please ask the FIL for 
information on whether or not SPM changes the order of the pixels in the .img 
file to represent the neurological orientation.  You will find SPM help at
<a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/help/">
         http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/help/</a>.  
You will also find some information about SPM handling of Analyze files at:
<a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm99.html#AzeFmt">
         http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm99.html#AzeFmt</a>
</p>

<p>John Ashburner offerred the following comments:<br>
The SPM99-SPM2 differences are documented at
<a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm2.html#Compat">
         http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm2.html#Compat</a>. 
The SPM2 orientation is now the same as that of Analyze (when flip=1).<br>

Unlike PET images, MR images can be acquired in any orientation.  Because
of this, it is better to consider the handedness of the data, rather than
the orientation of a single slice.  For example, an image can be rotated
by 180 degrees around the Y axis, which would flip the left-right ordering
of the voxels within a plane.  The image would still have the same
handedness though.  Mapping from voxels to co-ordinates in some mm space
is done via a .mat file, so the actual ordering of the data is unimportant
(provided the handedness is correct).<br>

The NIFTI file format should be finalised soon. This will incorporate the affine transform
within it.</p>



<p>I understand that MRIcro has been developed in conjunction with SPM and it 
provides the option to flip files left/right.  Chris Rorden has web pages that
clarify whether the .hdr has -ve pixdim values and how to interpret them, 
also how the .img file is written out of MRIcro/SPM99/SPM2 for each of the 
neurological and radiological orientations.  MRIcro does not read any .mat
files (as of Jan 2004). You will find MRIcro at
<a href="http://www.mricro.com/">
         http://www.mricro.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>According to Chris, SPM2 and SPM99 always show images in NEUROLOGICAL orientation.<br>
<ul>
<li>With SPM2, the data is stored in LAS format (first byte = RIGHT), ie:<br>
 X increases from Right to Left (L)<br>
 Y increases from Posterior to Anterior (A)<br>
 Z increases from Inferior to Superior (S)<br>
If you change "defaults.analyze.flip = 1;" to "defaults.analyze.flip = 0;" 
in the spm_defaults.m file then SPM2 uses RAS (first byte = LEFT).</li>
<li>With SPM99, the data is stored in RAS format (first byte = LEFT).</li>
<li>By default, SPM99 flips left-right in the image during normalization. 
This is controlled by the "sptl_Ornt" value in spm_defaults.m. Regardless 
of the setting, images are always displayed in NEUROLOGICAL ordering (RAS).</li>
</ul>

         http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR5/file_types.html#voxelorder</a>.
Also, this description of the AIR internal coordinate system is informative:
<a href="http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR5/coordinates.html">
         http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR5/coordinates.html</a>.
Note that the image voxel order specifies axial .img files, but it does 
not specify whether +X is left (radiological/Analyze) or +X right.  It does
indicate that larger X indices are assigned to each successive voxel in the
.img file (for each row of the axial .img file).  Lastly, the AIR page on
homogenous coordinates is a nice introduction to the information used for
registration matrices, see
<a href="http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/AIR5/homogenous.html">

Note the following comment,
"The data in the .BRIK is stored in the order (orientation) in which the images 
were loaded into to3d. So, in order to know how to slice through a data set you 
need to look into the Info structure (output of BrikInfo and BrikLoad). I have 
included the AFNI* functions to help shed some light into the darkness."
